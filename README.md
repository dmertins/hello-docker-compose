```

All application services are configured in the Compose file.

## Requirements
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) â‰¥ 20.10.17

## Running the application stack

To run the application services:
```console
$ docker compose up --build
```

To check the application containers status:
```console
$ docker compose ps
```

The web application listens on port `8080`. To access the application, open a web browser and go to the following address:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

To stop the application services:
```console
$ docker compose down
```

## Running the application in development mode

In development mode, the application source code is bind mounted into the running container, and [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) automatically restarts the application when file changes are detected. These configuration are defined in the Compose development file.

To run the application in development mode:
```console
$ docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.dev.yaml up --build
```
